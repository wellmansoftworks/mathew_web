            Terraria is a 2-D sandbox crafting / survival game where the main objective is to continueously get better gear to slay stronger bosses

        <p>
            What I <i> really</i> like about the game mainly is the sheer diversity of items and things to do.
            <br>
            There are nearly 3000+ items in the game currently (<b>Almost half of which are weapons and armour</b>) and there are (in the PC version) <b>13 bosses</b> to fight, each one having there own attack patterns and unique drops.
