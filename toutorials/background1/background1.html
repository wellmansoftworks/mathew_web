		<h1>Baked Garlic</h1>
		<p>Garlic may be known for being a little bit stinky, but baked it is absolutely delicious and as long as you feed it to all of your guests no-one will complain about the smell! Once baked the garlic becomes creamy and sweet making an ideal spread to accompany cheese.</p>
		
		<p>To make your own baked garlic, you will need:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Whole heads of garlic</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Olive Oil</li>
			<li>Foil</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Cut the tops and bottoms off the garlic heads with a sharp knife, keeping the head intact, then snip the tops of the cloves so you can see the garlic inside.</li>
			<li>In a large ovenproof dish use foil to make a 'nest' large enough to hold all of your garlic. If you are doing a lot of garlic you could put them into several nests.</li>
			<li>Add a few tablespoons of water to the nest then add the garlic heads.</li>
			<li>Pour over a tablespoon of olive oil per garlic, season with salt and tightly wrap up the top of the foil nest to seal in the garlic.</li>
			<li>Bake for 30 minutes at 200C, open the nest and baste the garlic in the juices, then cover and bake for another 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
		</ol>
