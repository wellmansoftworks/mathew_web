<h1>Halo - Combat Evolved</h1>

<p style="padding-top:40px;">	This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It
offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay
(reminiscent of Tribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements.
Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's
surface in a troop carrier, Ã  la Aliens. As the player and fellow
marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an
oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies. 
</p>

<p>It's this smart AI
system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very
nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As
you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and
on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and
the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and
motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in
the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four
players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for
LAN play. However you choose to hero your way through Halo: Combat
Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.
